# Please Help

My name is Bogdan and I was recently layed off. I'm currently trying to setup my own business by name "unburdened" but you have the perfect GitHub username. It aligns perfectly with the company's name. Would you be willing to transfer the username to me (it's a matter of simply renaming your GitHub username to something else to have it become available)? I would be extremely grateful. Please let me know what you would like for this or if I can help you in any way. Thank you!
